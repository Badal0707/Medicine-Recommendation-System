# Medicine-Recommendation-System
I made  a Medicine Recommendation System project using Python and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes patient data and symptoms to recommend the most suitable medications. It considers various factors such as dosage guidelines and potential contraindications to ensure that recommendations are both safe and effective. By the use of machine learning algorithms, the system improves the accuracy of medication suggestions compared to traditional methods and speeds up the decision-making process for healthcare providers. This leads to more personalized patient care and a more efficient healthcare system overall.
